Hello I'm Lion! I'm currently working on Witchbrook as a programmer at Chucklefish in London.

I've started my programming journey back when I was twelve years old with writing little mods for Minecraft. After I've noticed how much I enjoyed programming I started to learn C++ and attended the Games Academy in Frankfurt. 

One year before my graduation I landed a job at Ubisoft Mainz in november 2017 and then moved over to Ubisoft DÃ¼sseldorf in november 2018. I was mainly working on engine and rendering related tasks there.

Since I've started my career I had the opportunity to meet and work with many talented people around the globe!

It's nice to meet you!
