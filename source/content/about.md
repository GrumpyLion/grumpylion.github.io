Hello, I'm Lion! I'm currently working on the snowdrop engine as an engine programmer at Ubisoft Düsseldorf.

I've started my journey at Ubisoft Mainz in november 2017 and then moved over to Ubisoft Düsseldorf in november 2018. 
Since I've joined Ubisoft, I had the opportunity to meet and work with many talented people around the globe!

It's nice to meet you!
